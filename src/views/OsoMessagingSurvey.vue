      .slide-headline been doing this longer than anyone else, and have built a carefully crafted product which: 1. supercharges development through our core engine, Polar, that is opinionated enough to simplify the most common use cases, but flexible enough to meet the most unique requirements 2. empowers you to control how much data to centralize or not, fine-tuning it to your needs 3. offers best-in-class robustness and performance for one of the most critical areas of any app.
